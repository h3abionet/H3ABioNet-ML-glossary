A data visualization technique which has been invented by Professor Teuvo Kohonen and is based on dimension reduction using self-organizing neural networks. SOM, just like PCA, is also based on dimension reduction. However SOM produces a map, typically of 2 dimensions, and plots the similarities of the data by grouping similar data items together.
