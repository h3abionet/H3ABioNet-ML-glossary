## k-means clustering
The k-means algorithm was devised by MacQueen in 1967 and is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms used for solving the clustering problem. It classifies a given data set through a predefined of clusters (set by the parameter k). Data points inside a cluster are homogeneous and heterogeneous to peer groups.

## Applications
 * The k-means algorithm was used in a gene expression study to zoom in on a small subset of novel light-regulated RNA molecules in _Arabidopsis thaliana_ from microarray data <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180043/">ref</a>
