Used in gene expression studies to identify the functions of previously unstudied genes  - to reduce the data set [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180043/ ]
The K-means algorithm was devised by MacQueen in 1967 and is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms used for solving the clustering problem. 
It classifies a given data set through a certain number of clusters (assume k clusters). Data points inside a cluster are homogeneous and heterogeneous to peer groups.
