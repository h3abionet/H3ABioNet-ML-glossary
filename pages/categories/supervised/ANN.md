## Artificial Neural Networks 

Artificial neural network is a computational model based on the structure and function of a neuronal network. It works like the way human brain processes information. It includes a number of connected nodes organised in layers, where output from each node is passed as input to each node of the next layer, finally producing output from the terminal layer. Weightings can be applied to the signals passing forward from one layer to the next, and these weightings are tuned in the training phase. 

## Applications

1. Promoter recognition [ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2818859). 
2. Drug resistance prediction in HIV [ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5558779/).
