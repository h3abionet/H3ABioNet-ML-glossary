## Logistic regression 

Logistic regression is a statistical method, where there is a single outcome (label) that is binary (dichotomous), and is determined by multiple independent (explanatory/predictor) variables. The aim is to describe the best-fitting model that explains the relationship between the set of independent variables and the outcome. 

## Applications

Classify disease using microarray data: model selection in a large p and small n case [ref](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btm287).
