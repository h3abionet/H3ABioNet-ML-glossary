## Gradient Boosting Algorithms 

Gradient boosting algorithms use an ensemble of decision trees and weights the observations that are harder to classify [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting). 

## Applications

Predict protein solvent accessibility, which is a pivotal intermediate step towards modeling protein tertiary structures directly from one-dimensional sequences  [ref](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-015-0851-2).
