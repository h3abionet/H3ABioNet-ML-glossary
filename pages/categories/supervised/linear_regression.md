## Linear Regression
Linear regression is used when the value being predicted is not a “yes” or “no”, but falls somewhere on a continuous spectrum. Regression systems can be used, for example, to answer questions such as “How much?” or “How many?”

## Applications
Correlate the codon usage pattern with the protein regulation level using linear regression models [ref](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2012.07.003).
