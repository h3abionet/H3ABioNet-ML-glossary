## Support Vector Machines 

In support vector machines, each data item is plotted as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is the number of features). The value of each feature is the value of a particular coordinate. 

## Applications

1. classify between disease group and non-disease group like a Decision Tree. 
2. prediction of membrane protein types in whole sequences. 
3. prediction of translation initiation sites in biological sub-sequences [ref](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/5.4.328).
