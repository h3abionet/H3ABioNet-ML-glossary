## Naïve Bayes 

Naïve Bayes is a classification technique based on Bayes’ theorem where predictors are assumed to be independent of each other. In other words, a Naïve Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a feature in a class is not related to any other feature presence or absence – so independently contribute to the probability. Particularly useful for very large datasets, and benefits are simplicity and performance.
