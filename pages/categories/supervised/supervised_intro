# Supervised Learning

Supervised machine learning is analogous to a student learning a subject by studying a set of questions and their corresponding answers. After mastering the mapping between questions and answers, the student can then provide answers to new (never-before-seen) questions on the same topic.
Supervised learning is a data mining task of deducing a function from labelled training data. The training data consists of a set of training examples, where each consists of a pair of data containing an input and the desired output value. 
It makes use of a supervised learning algorithm which needs humans to provide both input and the desired output, in addition to providing the machine with feedback on the outcomes during the training phase. Once training is complete, the algorithm will apply what was learned to new data.
