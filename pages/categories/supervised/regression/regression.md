Regression is used to describe (or model) the relationship between the set of features (samples) in a dataset and a corresponding set of continuous numerical response variables (outputs). Some examples include simple and multiple linear regression (these fit a linear model to the input training data), ridge regression, Lasso, nearest neighbours and Kernel regression. 
| Classification | Regression |
|---|---|
| Discrete, categorical variable                      | Continuous (real number range) |
| Supervised classification problem                   | Supervised classification problem |
| Assign the output to a class (a label)              | Predict the output value using training data |
| Predict the type of tumour (harmful vs not harmful) | Predict a house price, predict survival time |
